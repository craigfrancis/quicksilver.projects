quicksilver.projects
====================

If you have a folder per website/project, using a format such as:

project/
	app - Website
	resources - Random files
	httpd - Apache config files

Where you typically just want to automatically open "app" in TextMate 1.

With this plugin, you can start typing the project name in QuickSilver, then automatically open its "app" (or "public") folder... or press the "/" key and choose which of the sub-folders to open.

As this is my first attempt at ObjectiveC, everything is hard coded, so the project folders will need to sit in:

	/Volumes/WebServer/Projects/
